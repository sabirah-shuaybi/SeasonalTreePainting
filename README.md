# SeasonalTreePainting
Interactive Tree Painting Panels for Each Season plus a Standard Panel 

Project/Assignment split into two parts:
The first part consists of a TreePainting class that makes a GUI for an interactive tree painting. 
The second part consists of four subclasses of TreePainting that inherit much of the functionality of the 
TreePainting class, but override some methods to display seasonal paintings (winter, spring, summer, and fall).
